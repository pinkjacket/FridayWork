# _Friday Study Log_

_**James Donlan**_

I have a lot of things I'd like to get a jump on, so it's a little tough to narrow it down to just one or two for today. That said, I've long wished I could do a bit more with CSS than just background colors and borders so I think I'll be looking into some design stuff. I also bought a bunch of udemy classes in January that I've barely touched, so I may spend some time on those today. I also always have some project planning I could be doing, but that's not all technical and I suspect a document full of creative writing isn't what you're hoping to see from today, so we'll see if anything actually comes of that.
I'll be making an effort to keep this file updated as the day goes along, anyway.


### _Notes_

_Design for non-designers_
* Grids help reduce clutter
* limit the number of colors you use (I actually learned this a while back while attempting sprite work)
* if you don't have time to actually learn color theory, use a palette builder online
* Don't use a lot of weird fonts for no reason
* Use whitespace
* consider the user experience
* design with the purpose of your project in mind
* less text is more
* avoid getting deep into unnecessary details
* run things by others for feedback
* reference things
* don't copy though
* think about the designs of things you look at
* the first pass is always going to look terrible
