# _Friday Study Log_

_**James Donlan**_

I have a lot of things I'd like to get a jump on, so it's a little tough to narrow it down to just one or two for today. That said, I've long wished I could do a bit more with CSS than just background colors and borders so I think I'll be looking into that a bit. I also bought a bunch of udemy classes in January that I've barely touched, so I may spend some time on those today. I also always have some project planning I could be doing, but that's not all technical and I suspect a document full of creative writing isn't what you're hoping to see from today, so we'll see if anything actually comes of that.
I'll be making an effort to keep this file updated as the day goes along, anyway.
