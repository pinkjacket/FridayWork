# _Friday Study Log_

_**James Donlan**_

I have a lot of things I'd like to get a jump on, so it's a little tough to narrow it down to just one or two for today. That said, I've long wished I could do a bit more with CSS than just background colors and borders so I think I'll be looking into some design stuff. I also bought a bunch of udemy classes in January that I've barely touched, so I may spend some time on those today. I also always have some project planning I could be doing, but that's not all technical and I suspect a document full of creative writing isn't what you're hoping to see from today, so we'll see if anything actually comes of that.
I'll be making an effort to keep this file updated as the day goes along, anyway.


### _Notes_

_Design for non-designers_
* Grids help reduce clutter
* limit the number of colors you use (I actually learned this a while back while attempting sprite work)
* if you don't have time to actually learn color theory, use a palette builder online
* Don't use a lot of weird fonts for no reason
* Use whitespace
* consider the user experience
* design with the purpose of your project in mind
* less text is more
* avoid getting deep into unnecessary details
* run things by others for feedback
* reference things
* don't copy though
* think about the designs of things you look at
* the first pass is always going to look terrible

I was thinking about buying the book that goes with these articles but it's like 40 dollars and my individual book budget tends to be more in the $10-20 range so maybe not today.

_CSS documentation_
I was looking for more tutorials but I can't tell which ones are going to be any good so I just went to the mozilla documentation and I'll see if I learn anything interesting.
* box height/width ignores percentages, always adopt the dimensions of their content unless you set them in pixels or ems
* overflow can be used to determine how content too big for a box is handled, including automatically adding scroll bars
* outline is similar to border, but not actually part of the box model
* background-position allows for fine control over where background images go
* linear-gradient lets you make color gradients really easily, repeating-linear-gradient makes it repeat
* background-attachment determines whether the background scrolls with the content or not
* all background properties can be put on one line via shorthand
* you can put multiple backgrounds on one element
* you can make borders out of images but I can't see ever actually needing to do so
* there's some pretty impressive stuff you can do with filtering and color-blending but I'm gonna have to come back to take a closer look at that another time because it looks complicated
* boxes can be flexible, autoadjusting to fill the space they're in
* positioning lets you break elements out of the usual flow of a document

there's a tutorial here about making a tabbed infobox that looks interesting but I may tackle that over the weekend

I've looked around for some more design stuff but it's always hard to tell at a glance what's going to actually be useful. Therefore, I think I'm going to spend the last couple hours today trying to put a dent in the Udemy courses I picked up in January. The work is in C# and uses Unity, which as far as I can tell is a giant pain to put on github, but I'll do my best to provide a few pictures and summarize what gets done.

_Unity Pictures_

As mentioned above, putting a Unity project on github seems to be a whole ordeal in and of itself. I could just upload the C# code but I'm not sure it works without Unity. Here's a link to a picture or two of what I spent the last of the afternoon working on, though, plus some of the other classes I have waiting for me. Almost all of them require a working knowledge of C# and Unity so for now I have to focus on the first one. There's Blender, but to use Blender you have to learn how to navigate the program itself, which is why you don't learn how to actually model anything until two hours into that course.

It's a basic text adventure. I'll see if I can finish it over the weekend.
